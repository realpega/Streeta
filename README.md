# Streeta - Open Source Women Safety Project

## Build Steps:


### `Android Studio`

If you want to build the app without changing the Gradle version, you can use <a href="https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2021.1.1.20/android-studio-2021.1.1.20-windows.exe">Android Studio Bumblebee | 2021.1.1</a>

If you want to build the app on the latest version of Gradle, you need to download the latest version of <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> along with the latest version of <a href="https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.10.1-bin.zip">Gradle</a>.

Remember to modify the `XML` files to comply with the new `ConstraintLayout` format and modify the `JAVA` files accordingly to deal with the Deprecated APIs.
